# Mini version of the classic grep command on Linux

## From the rust book

To test the code, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Rust installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/markhristov/minigrep.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the directory containing the code:

   ```bash
   cd https://github.com/markhristov/minigrep.git
   ```

4. Compile and run the code using Cargo. Execute the following command:

   ```bash
   cargo run -- poem.txt > output.txt
   ```

   This command will run the program, reading input from `poem.txt` and redirecting the output to `output.txt`.

5. Check the `output.txt` file to verify the results.

6. You can modify `poem.txt` with your own input text file to test different inputs.

Enjoy testing the code!
